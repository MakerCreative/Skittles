Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError
pi@raspberrypi ~/makercreative/Skittles $ 

the problem was that the python cnc.py was looking for 'ok' as a response from grbl but wasn't getting it before the timeout. i increased the time timeout to 5 seconds but also added a 3x retry if we hit the same condition.also added a delay before sending the next command between each drill in the user program (drillHoles.py).
